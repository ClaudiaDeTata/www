# My first README file for my first project. 

"www" is the name assigned to the folder and title of the project.

This is the beginning of my journey into coding.

I am a newbie at her first steps into this world, studying at the Edinburgh college, this is all part of the introduction to the Coding Bootcamp.

This project contains the various assignments I have been completing during the course.

The first tool I dived into, is Bootstrap 5.2. With the aid of HTML and CSS as well, I have created responsive and mobile first webpages, utilising all the elements I have been learning to use, throughout the course.

This readme file will be updated while I learn, so that's it for now!
